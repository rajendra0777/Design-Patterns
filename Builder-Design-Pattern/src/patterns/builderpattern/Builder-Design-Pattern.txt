Builder Design Pattern
----------------------
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. 
The intent of the Builder Pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the same
construction process can create different representations

Example: Building different types of cars (SUV, Sports Car) using the same steps but different components.



========
Problem
========

1. Class with lot many attributes
2. Before creating object it requires validation -> age>18, email validate, student with above 60%


	- Validation using constructor.
	- We can also validate in setter but not before object creation.
	- We can't validate using 2 or more attributes inside setter.

3. Telescoping constuctor(Bad Design).
4. N Number of constructor will be there.
5. If class has 20 attributes then it can't be possible to have all combination of constructor


============
When to USE
============

1. Class with lot many attributes
2. Immutable object
3. Object Validation
4. To seperate construction of complex object from its representation.


=========
Use Case
=========

1. Setting params in API calls.
2. Prepare query for DB call.
3. Constructing Reports or Documents
